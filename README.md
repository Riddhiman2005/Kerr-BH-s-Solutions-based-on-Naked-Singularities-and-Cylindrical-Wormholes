# [Kerr BH’s solutions based on Naked Singularities and Cylindrical Wormholes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvkAemSOnqmsw9GnWLKim54PAi_s4bip/view?usp=sharing) #


In Einstein’s Theory of GR, Schwarzschild’s solution gives a
mathematical explanation of the gravitational potential around
a spherically symmetric object with properties like zero charge,
zero mass, and zero cosmological constants. So, in this paper which is based on mathematics of BH, I focussed to create
the mathematical structure and formulation of wormhole from
Naked Singularity of Kerr BH without event Horizon and ergo-
sphere, considering time as imaginary to remove the concept
of eternatilty of time. Also, through this paper I came to the
conclusion that every parameter of a BH is altered by a ”Naked
Singularity” and spin angular momentum is necessary for the creation of a wormhole as well as the removal of the event horizon
and singularity
